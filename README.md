# ETH dApp - Refund by Location

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case with an Ethereum smart contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract. 
The Ethereum-smart-contract dApp is implemented to verify the other party in the contract has stayed within a predefined geographical location and based  on that information it handles payment accordingly.
